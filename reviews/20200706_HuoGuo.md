## Blockers

- [ ] S-D18: decaying rat prevents reimaging required to properly segment the PNS; registration-based approach will be tried, to merge PNS images from previously scanned rat
- [ ] Continuous work on Platform stability is time-consuming but essential work and may delay other milestones
- [ ] S-D20: Martin Bertrand’s work on the detailed pelvic PNS functionalization will be delayed
- [ ] Migration to AWS: High priority tasks related to Z43's energy infrastructure retain our DevOps resources and delay the completion of this one.
