> **Voyager** is a sprint theme inspired by NASA‚Äôs Voyager mission, which carried humanity‚Äôs curiosity beyond the bounds of our solar system. On February 14, 1990, Voyager 1 captured the famous Pale Blue Dot photograph of Earth‚Äîa humbling reminder of our place in the vast cosmos. This theme embodies exploration, discovery, and pushing beyond known limits.
