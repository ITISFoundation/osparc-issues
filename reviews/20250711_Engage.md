> **Engage** is a sprint theme inspired by *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, where Captain Jean-Luc Picard famously uses the command ‚ÄúEngage‚Äù to initiate warp travel. It symbolizes decisive action, team alignment, and forward momentum‚Äîideal for kickoff sprints or phases focused on execution and rapid progress.
