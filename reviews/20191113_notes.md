## Notes for NIH review ##

- Talked about blockers: decaying rat and Gazelle's meetings. NIH will come back about the schedule with Gazelle since we do not have the resources
- Then demo with e to e testing: ewa asked and we confirmed that it tests everything on the platform except perhaps a dynamic service
  - offline, Nina asked for documentation about e2e testing.
  - Github issue was sent to Nina and Ewa
- spoke about and demo-ed the activity manager
  - Ewa wanted to know how to explore all of the available studies and other functionality on osparc
  - this was explained and also we will make sure that it is covered on the osparc specific documentation in case it it is not there already
- Creation of data processing modules: survey. Abby: is this survey open to other cores? Esra: this would be specific to the data analysis requirements and it was already documented. Andrew: data wranglers may not be best people for this survey because they may not be the ones analyzing the data. Perhaps ask them to please share with the team members who are actually doing the analysis. Esra: yes we want to target the entire group and hope that they will spend some time to fill out the form. In addition, Z43 will soon be asked to become beta testers for osparc, particularly for python
- talked about retreat slide
- in-silico studies: should we present that also for the steering committee?
   - Andrew: that is a month 10 milestone so we don't expect that for the steering committe meeting
- talked about the scope of GazelleCX's contribution and the deliverables
- Deterimined there is a need to have a meeting between Gazelle, Simcore, and NIH to try to resolve their blockers
