## Blockers
- [ ] S-D18: decaying rat prevents reimaging required to properly segment the PNS; registration-based approach will be tried, to merge PNS images from previously scanned rat
- [ ] S-D9: Gazelle requires support in scheduling their meetings and calls with focus groups, stake owners, etc.
