## to create milestones in multiple repositories
- firstly you need to create a github token
  - in Github settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens -> *Generate new token*
    - Change resource owner -> ITISFoundation
    - Choose Repository access -> All repositories
    - Choose Permissions -> Repository permissions -> Issues (Read and Write)
  - Now somebody with organization admin rights must approve your token
- use the code in scripts/milestones.py
- do the following
```bash
# to show the help
make
# to install the requirements
make devenv
source .venv/bin/activate
# to create a milestone
# NOTE: you need a token in github to run these recipes
# In order to use these scripts one needs to:
# - get a Personal Access Token on github: https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
#   - Resource owner must be ITISFoundation
#   - Repository access must be: All repositories
#   - Permissions on repositories: Issues ReadWrite

# to create a new milestone
make new-milestone token=GITHUB_TOKEN title="dummy-name" due_on="2030-03-12"
# to delete the milestone
make delete-milestone token=GITHUB_TOKEN title="dummy-name"

# to close previous milestone
make modify-milestone title="dummy-name" nstate=closed
```

The code to create milestone uses a hard-coded list of repositories, don't be shy update it if it's missing information. Also, as this is open source, just feel free to improve the code...
