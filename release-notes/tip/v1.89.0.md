# Release Notes

### Version 1.89.0 · February 12, 2026  

Safer collaboration. Smoother account flows.

This release focuses on improving the core experience around **project setup and user account management** — with refinements that make everyday workflows more predictable and less error-prone.

## ✨ Highlights

### 💳 Billing Center: Less Guessing, More Clarity

The **Billing Center now automatically preselects your active wallet**, so you land directly in the right billing context.

We’ve also improved how payment options are presented, making it clearer which method is being used and reducing friction during payment flows.

Small change — big reduction in confusion.

### 🏷️ Tag Projects at Creation

Organization now starts earlier.

When creating a project you can now **assign tags immediately**. No need to create first and organize later.

This helps teams keep workspaces structured from day one, especially in environments with many parallel projects.

### 🔐 Safer & Clearer Project Permissions

We’ve refined how permissions behave and are displayed, reducing the risk of accidental destructive actions and clarifying who can do what inside shared projects.

This means:
- Better alignment between UI behavior and actual roles  
- Clearer boundaries between owners, editors, and collaborators  
- Fewer “wait, why can I do this?” moments

### 🧾 Cleaner Account & Profile Flows

Account-related interactions received a polish pass:
- Improved handling of optional contact information  
- Fixes and refinements in phone verification  
- Better consistency in how user data is displayed and validated  

These changes make account setup and maintenance more reliable and less frustrating.
