# Release Notes
### Highlights


### Introducing User-Friendly Usernames! 🎉
We’ve updated how users are identified across the platform. Now, instead of email addresses, **usernames** will be the go-to unique identifier in the following areas:
- **Sharing Made Simpler:** Usernames are displayed when sharing resources.
- **Adding Users to Organizations:** Quickly find and add users by their username.
- **Tooltips for Shared Resources:** See usernames at a glance for better clarity.

Why this change?
- **Easier collaboration:** Usernames are more concise and easier to recognize.
- **Enhanced user experience:** Avoid sharing personal email addresses in public or team spaces.

Personalize Your Username

Your email address will still be used for logging in, but you can customize your username to reflect your identity or preferences. Simply go to the My Account section to update your username anytime.


### Ways to Connect and Share! 🔎
You can now share with users on the platform by searching for their username. In addition, we’ve added flexible search options to enhance discoverability:
- **Search by Email or Full Name:** These options are hidden by default to prioritize your **privacy**. However, you can enable them in the My Account section to make yourself even easier to find!


### Introducing the Trash Bin! 🗑️
Say goodbye to accidental deletions! We’ve added a Trash Bin to the platform, giving you more control and flexibility when managing your resources.

How it works:
- **What can be trashed?** Studies, Folders, and Workspaces can now be moved to the Trash Bin.
- **30-Day Grace Period:** Trashed items will remain in the Trash Bin for 30 days before being permanently deleted.
- **Restore with Ease:** Need something back? You can restore trashed items anytime within the 30-day window.
This feature ensures peace of mind and provides an extra layer of security for your valuable work.


### Enhanced Folders and Workspaces Experience! 🚀
We’ve made some improvements to the Folders and Workspaces feature:
- **Enhanced Drag-and-Drop Support:** You can now easily drag and drop Studies and Folders to reorganize your dashboard. Moving things around is now quicker and smoother!
- **Bug Fix Folder Study Limit:** We’ve fixed a bug that previously limited the number of Studies displayed in a Folder to just 5. You can now see and access all your Studies without limitations.


### Share Your Tags! 🏷️
You can now share your tags with others! This enhancement makes it easier to collaborate and organize your Studies with teammates. Simply share them with others to improve discoverability and streamline collaboration.
