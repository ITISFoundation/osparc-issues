# Release Notes

### Version 1.88.0 · January 13, 2026

More clarity. Less guesswork. Fewer “wait… what just happened?” moments.

This release focuses on **UI improvements that make everyday workflows smoother**: clearer project setup, friendlier project settings, safer actions for collaborators, and better feedback while things are starting up.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🧭 Project settings that explain themselves

Project cards now include short intro texts in key sections (Billing Settings, Boot Options, Sharing, Tags), so you don’t have to guess what a panel does before clicking around.

</div>

### 🛡️ Safer collaboration: editors can’t “oops-delete” projects

If you’re an **Editor** on a shared project, the UI now behaves like you’d expect:
- You can **leave/remove the shared project from your list**
- You **cannot delete** the project (that stays an Owner-only power)

This also improves the wording and flow so it’s clear whether you’re deleting, trashing, or just removing access.

</div>

### ⏳ Better feedback while services start

During the **Sidecar Pulling** step, the UI now gives **useful progress feedback** instead of jumping from 0% → 100% with nothing in between. This makes startup feel much less mysterious, especially when you’re waiting ~20 seconds and wondering if it’s stuck.

</div>

### 🧩 A calmer, tidier UI

A bunch of small UX tweaks that add up:
- Floating windows are now kept within the screen (no more losing dialogs off-canvas).
- Read-only fields now use a transparent background style (cleaner visual hierarchy).
- “Join / Open” button text is now dynamic, matching what will actually happen.
- Workspace member count display got fixed (“n members…” behaves properly).

### 🛠 Fixes

A few notable user-facing fixes from the changelog:
- Search results now correctly include directories (not just files).
- File Picker output handling was corrected (less friction when selecting outputs).
