# 🧠 TIP V4.0 Release Notes ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-4.0-blue)

**Release Date**: [05.06.2025]
**Contact**: [tip@itis.swiss](mailto:tip@itis.swiss)

> _“The Shortcut to Smart TI Stimulation” — Because Neurons Deserve Precision._

## 🚀 What’s New in TIP V4.0?

TIP V4.0 is the most advanced version yet of our temporal interference (TI) stimulation planning tool, designed for researchers and clinicians aiming for precision, efficiency, and reproducibility in noninvasive brain stimulation.

### ✨ Key Features & Improvements

#### 🔄 Automated Model Personalization
- No more manual fiducial point placement.
- A built-in neural network automatically detects anatomical landmarks based on the EEG 10-10 system.
- Enhances reproducibility and eliminates user-dependent errors.

#### 🧠 Smart Optimization Engine – SuMo
- Replaces the old “sweeper” with a **Surrogate Modeling-based Optimizer** (SuMo).
- Combines **Gaussian process modeling** and **multi-objective genetic algorithms**.
- Returns a diverse set of **Pareto-optimal solutions**, enabling clear trade-off evaluation (e.g., focality vs. intensity).

#### ⚡ Performance Gains
- Optimization runs now complete in **~50% less time** compared to TIP V3.0.
- Improved solution quality, supported by better **hypervolume performance indicators**.
- Full use of **parallel computing** for faster results.

#### 🧭 Enhanced User Workflow
- Three intuitive steps: model upload → protocol optimization → optional exposure analysis.
- Automation and visualization improvements streamline the process end-to-end.

#### 💬 Project Conversations: Talk Smarter, Not Louder

Collaboration just got a boost! Projects can now host multiple Conversations, so your team can:
- Discuss different topics in parallel
- Keep feedback and ideas organized
- Avoid stepping on each other’s toes in a single chat thread

Whether it’s planning, debugging, or feedback — now there’s a dedicated space for each part of the discussion.

## 💳 Wallets API Integration

TIP V4.0 now includes integration with a **Wallets API** to manage credit usage for simulations:

- ✅ Automatically checks a user’s **credit balance** before simulation runs.
- ❌ If the balance is insufficient, the simulation will not start.
- 💡 Users are prompted to **purchase additional credits** directly through the interface.

This ensures smoother access control and cost transparency for personalized simulations.

---

## 💻 Availability

TIP V4.0 is available free of charge to:
- Members of the **TI Solutions Early Adopter Program**
- **IT’IS Foundation** research partners

🧾 Users only cover AWS compute costs (~$60 per personalized subject).
📂 Precomputed models remain free to explore.

### 🚀 Improvements

* ⚡ **Faster Port Assignments**: Improved performance when assigning compatible ports between App's nodes — now quicker and more efficient!
* 🧭 **Snappier Dashboard**: Projects now load faster on the main dashboard for a smoother experience.
* 📈 **Expanded I/O Support**: Apps can now handle more than 10 inputs/outputs — more flexibility for complex workflows!

### 🛠️ No longer broken

* 🧰 **Download Issue Resolved**: Fixed a bug that blocked output ports from downloading, which was preventing dynamic services from starting properly.
* 📝 **Correct Project Naming**: Resolved an issue where projects appeared as `undefined-metadata` in the billing center — names now display correctly!
