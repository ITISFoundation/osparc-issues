# Release Notes

## ✨ Highlights

### 🏷️ Tag Projects at Creation (Even from Templates or Tutorials)

Organization now starts earlier.

When creating a project — including from a template or tutorial — you can now **assign tags immediately**. No need to create first and organize later.

This helps users and teams keep workspaces structured from day one, especially in environments with many parallel projects.

### 🔐 Safer & Clearer Project Permissions

We’ve refined how permissions behave and are displayed, reducing the risk of accidental destructive actions and clarifying who can do what inside shared projects.

This means:
- Better alignment between UI behavior and actual roles  
- Clearer boundaries between owners, editors, and collaborators  
- Fewer “wait, why can I do this?” moments

### 🧾 Cleaner Account & Profile Flows

Account-related interactions received a polish pass:
- Improved handling of optional contact information  
- Fixes and refinements in phone verification  
- Better consistency in how user data is displayed and validated  

These changes make account setup and maintenance more reliable and less frustrating.
