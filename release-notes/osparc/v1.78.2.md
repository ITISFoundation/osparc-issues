### 🎉 You Asked, We Delivered: Folders and Workspaces

We’ve heard your feedback loud and clear—organization and collaboration were at the top of your wish list. That’s why we’re excited to introduce Folders and Workspaces, two powerful tools to keep your Studies organized and your teamwork seamless.

#### Folders
Keep your Studies neatly organized with our new Folders feature! Folders, in your Workspace, are private to you and give you the flexibility to structure your files your way.

#### Workspaces
Meet Workspaces, your hub for collaboration. Designed specifically for teams, Workspaces let you and your team share all the content in them: Studies and Folders. Stay organized, and work together seamlessly—all in one place.
