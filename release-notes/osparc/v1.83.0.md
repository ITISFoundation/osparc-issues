# Release Notes

🚀 This Time, We’re Bringing the Big Guns

This release is packed with major upgrades designed to take your workflows to the next level. We’ve tackled long-standing requests and introduced powerful new features, including:
- A complete **Dashboard re-organization** for faster access and better project visibility.
- Powerful new **Hypertool** capabilities. **Metamodeling**: run pipelines in parallel by iterating over inputs with ease.
- A big step toward unifying workflows: the **Standalone apps** can now be converted into **Pipelines**, bridging the gap between mono- and multi-app usage.
- Clearer insight into what’s happening behind the scenes, plus tools to track your most recent **Activity**.
- A revamped **Conversations** feature to supercharge collaboration and keep everyone on the same page.
- The App Browser now includes even more Apps — go explore and see what new tools you can plug into your workflows!

…and much more under the hood to boost speed, clarity, and control.

## Highlights


### 🧭 Dashboard Re-organization

We’ve overhauled the Dashboard to make it clearer, more intuitive, and aligned with how users actually work. Here’s what’s new:
- Renaming for clarity:
  - *Studies* are now called **Projects**
  - *Services* are now called **Apps**
- **Templates**, as you know snapshots of Projects — a reusable starting point from which users can build up their own workflows —, were split into meaningful sections:
  - **Templates**: Under the Projects tab, you’ll now find templates you’ve created as well as those shared directly with you.
  - **Public Projects**: Also under the Projects tab, these are templates shared with the entire oSPARC community — great for discovery and inspiration. Feel free to spread your work with the community, making it easier than ever to contribute and collaborate.
  - **Tutorials**: A new section with curated templates to help newcomers get started and help all users better understand the full potential of oSPARC.

This re-organization not only improves navigation but also brings more visibility to the growing library of shared and educational resources.

### 🔄 From Standalone to Pipeline: Unifying Workflows

We’ve taken a big step toward bridging the gap between mono-app and multi-app pipelines. You can now convert standalone Apps into a pipeline Project with just a few clicks. This means:
 - You’re no longer locked into a single-app structure — expand your workflow as your needs grow.
 - Easily build on top of existing standalone work by adding new Apps, data processing steps, or visualization tools.
 - Move seamlessly between simple and complex workflows without starting from scratch.

This change makes it easier than ever to scale up your projects and take full advantage of oSPARC’s modular architecture.

### 📊 Activity Center & Activity Overview: Know What’s Going On

We’ve added new ways to give you clear, real-time insight into what’s happening behind the scenes — so you always know what’s running and where.
- The **Activity Center**, always available in the top navigation bar, shows you everything currently running across all your Projects.
- Want to check the run history of a specific Project? Just head to its **Activity Overview**, available directly from the Project card.

Together, these tools make it easier to track your work, spot issues, and stay in control of your simulations and runs.

</div>


### 💬 Project Conversations: Talk Smarter, Not Louder

Collaboration just got a boost! Projects can now host multiple Conversations, so your team can:
- Discuss different topics in parallel
- Keep feedback and ideas organized
- Avoid stepping on each other’s toes in a single chat thread

Whether it’s planning, debugging, or feedback — now there’s a dedicated space for each part of the discussion.

### Metamodeling

- Create functions?
- WVG todo: replace name of 'Metamodelling Tutorial' in function item with final name, which is not known yet.
- **New Functions**: Added the concept of Functions. A function is created from a project with given input parameters and output probes. Users can rerun functions over sets of parameters, or provide it to metamodelling services to e.g. perform uncertainty quantification. This feature is a limited beta at the moment, more information can be found in the MetaModelling Tutorial.


### 🚀 Improvements

* ⚡ **Faster Port Assignments**: Improved performance when assigning compatible ports between App's nodes — now quicker and more efficient!
* 🧭 **Snappier Dashboard**: Projects now load faster on the main dashboard for a smoother experience.
* 🔌 **Public API Enhancements**: Checkout details to [openapi specs](https://api.osparc.io/doc) and you can install the [`osparc` python client](https://itisfoundation.github.io/osparc-simcore-clients/#/)
  * Added support for filtering solver jobs by custom metadata
  * Introduced version display field in solver responses
  * Improved solver filtering by service key and version patterns
  * Added paginated solvers endpoint with advanced filtering
* 📈 **Expanded I/O Support**: Apps can now handle more than 10 inputs/outputs — more flexibility for complex workflows!


### 🛠️ No longer broken

* 🧰 **Download Issue Resolved**: Fixed a bug that blocked output ports from downloading, which was preventing dynamic services from starting properly.
* 📝 **Correct Project Naming**: Resolved an issue where projects appeared as `undefined-metadata` in the billing center — names now display correctly!
