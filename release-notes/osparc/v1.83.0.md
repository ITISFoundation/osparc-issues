# Release Notes

🚀 This Time, We’re Bringing the Big Guns

This release is packed with major upgrades designed to take your workflows to the next level. We’ve tackled long-standing requests and introduced powerful new features, including:
- A complete Dashboard re-organization for faster access and better project visibility.
- Powerful new **metamodeling** capabilities — run pipelines in parallel by iterating over inputs with ease.
- A big step toward unifying workflows: the mono-app pipeline is now converted into a multi-app structure, bridging the gap between mono- and multi-app usage.
- Clearer insight into what’s happening behind the scenes, plus tools to track your most recent runs.
- A revamped Conversations feature to supercharge collaboration and keep everyone on the same page.

…and much more under the hood to boost speed, clarity, and control.

### Highlights

🧭 Dashboard Re-organization

We’ve overhauled the Dashboard to make it clearer, more intuitive, and aligned with how users actually work. Here’s what’s new:
- Renaming for clarity:
  - *Studies* are now called **Projects**
  - *Services* are now called **Apps**
- **Templates** split into meaningful sections:
  - **Templates**: Under the Projects tab, you’ll now find templates you’ve created as well as those shared directly with you.
  - **Public Projects**: Also under the Projects tab, these are templates shared with the entire oSPARC community — great for discovery and inspiration.
  - **Tutorials**: A new section with curated templates to help newcomers get started and help all users better understand the full potential of oSPARC.

This re-organization not only improves navigation but also brings more visibility to the growing library of shared and educational resources.

- OM todo:
  - Explain new Tutorials tab
  - Template/Public project
  - Explain "Convert to Pipeline"
  - Activity Center
  - Activity Overview
  - Runs and Tasks
  - Create functions?
  - Multiple conversations per project
- WVG todo: replace name of 'Metamodelling Tutorial' in function item with final name, which is not known yet.


- **New Functions**: Added the concept of Functions. A function is created from a project with given input parameters and output probes. Users can rerun functions over sets of parameters, or provide it to metamodelling services to e.g. perform uncertainty quantification. This feature is a limited beta at the moment, more information can be found in the MetaModelling Tutorial.


### 🚀 Improvements

* ⚡ **Faster Port Assignments**: Improved performance when assigning compatible ports between App's nodes — now quicker and more efficient!
* 🧭 **Snappier Dashboard**: Projects now load faster on the main dashboard for a smoother experience.
* 🔌 **Public API Enhancements**: Checkout details to [openapi specs](https://api.osparc.io/doc) and you can install the [`osparc` python client](https://itisfoundation.github.io/osparc-simcore-clients/#/)
  * Added support for filtering solver jobs by custom metadata
  * Introduced version display field in solver responses
  * Improved solver filtering by service key and version patterns
  * Added paginated solvers endpoint with advanced filtering
* 📈 **Expanded I/O Support**: Apps can now handle more than 10 inputs/outputs — more flexibility for complex workflows!


### 🛠️ No longer broken

* 🧰 **Download Issue Resolved**: Fixed a bug that blocked output ports from downloading, which was preventing dynamic services from starting properly.
* 📝 **Correct Project Naming**: Resolved an issue where projects appeared as `undefined-metadata` in the billing center — names now display correctly!
