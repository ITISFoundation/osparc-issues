# Release Notes


### ➕ Where Did the Plus Buttons Go?

We’ve streamlined the interface by merging the plus buttons (New Empty Study and New Folder) into a single, more powerful bigger New Plus button! It has been relocated to the top left for better accessibility and now includes additional functionality to enhance your workflow: your favorite (most used) services can now be found there for quicker access.
