# 🚀 Release Notes - Version 1.81.0

We’re back with a fresh update focused on improving usability, transparency, and reliability. This release introduces enhancements to how you manage data, gives you more control over your privacy settings, and helps you (and us!) debug more efficiently with smarter error handling. Let’s dive into the details:


### 📁 Smoother Data Handling Experience

Managing your Study data just got easier and more intuitive. This update introduces several improvements to the data browser, all designed to help you work more efficiently:
- At-a-glance size info: You can now see the total size of a Study or individual node right at the top-left corner of the Study files window.
- Smarter navigation: We've reworked the way file structures load behind the scenes—only what’s needed is fetched, making navigation faster and smoother. This also resolves the previous 3,000-item limitation per Study.
- Refreshed design: The data browser got a visual upgrade to make exploring your files a cleaner, more pleasant experience.

### 🔒 More Privacy Control: Opt-Out of Discoverability
By default, users are discoverable by their **username** —this helps sharing faster and more intuitive: just start typing a username, and matching suggestions will appear.

However, we understand that some users may prefer to stay under the radar. That’s why we’ve introduced a new opt-out option: you can now choose to make your username non-discoverable.
- Full Name and Email address are private by default.
- To update your discoverability settings, head to My Account settings → Privacy.
