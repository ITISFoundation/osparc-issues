# 🚀 Release Notes - Version 1.81.0

We’re back with a fresh update focused on improving usability, transparency, and reliability. This release introduces enhancements to how you manage data, gives you more control over your privacy settings, and helps you (and us!) debug more efficiently with smarter error handling. Let’s dive into the details:


### 📁 Smoother Data Handling Experience

Managing your Project data just got easier and more intuitive. This update introduces several improvements to the data browser, all designed to help you work more efficiently:
- At-a-glance size info: You can now see the total size of a Project or individual node right at the top-left corner of the Project files window.
- Smarter navigation: We've reworked the way file structures load behind the scenes—only what’s needed is fetched, making navigation faster and smoother. This also resolves the previous 3,000-item limitation per Project.
- Refreshed design: The data browser got a visual upgrade to make exploring your files a cleaner, more pleasant experience.

### 🔒 More Privacy Control: Opt-Out of Discoverability
By default, users are discoverable by their **username** —this helps sharing faster and more intuitive: just start typing a username, and matching suggestions will appear.

However, we understand that some users may prefer to stay under the radar. That’s why we’ve introduced a new opt-out option: you can now choose to make your username non-discoverable.
- Full Name and Email address are private by default.
- To update your discoverability settings, head to My Account settings → Privacy.

### ⚠️ Improved Error Handling for Clearer Feedback
We've worked hard to enhance the error messaging experience. In this release, we’ve introduced concise error descriptions. Here’s what's new:
- Support ID code: Each failure now includes a support identifier code (as `OEC:XXXX-YYYY`) and displayed in the Flash Message. This code helps us trace issues more efficiently.
- Copy to Clipboard: You can easily copy the Support ID along with additional context by clicking the new “Copy to Clipboard” button. This context is invaluable for diagnosing and resolving errors quickly.

If you encounter an error that persists, don’t hesitate to reach out—we’re always here to help, and we’re just a message away!
