## The Platform

## Version 1.85.0 · September 9, 2025

This release is a lighter one — while we’re finalizing some big upcoming features, we focused here on polishing the platform, fixing issues, and making incremental improvements to keep your Sim4Life experience smooth and reliable.

Stay tuned: more exciting updates are just around the corner!

## ✨ Highlights

#### 🧠 Metamodeling
The Functions Browser:
- You can now **share your functions** with others.
- The **search** bar makes it easy to quickly find the function you need.

#### ☁️ More Power for Your Apps
You can now **run more apps at the same time — faster and without interruptions**. Whether it’s Sim4Life, Jupyter, or other heavy apps, the platform now taps into expanded cloud resources to keep everything running smoothly for everyone.

## 🛠 Fixes
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from **sharing their workspaces**.
- Improved **button visibility in the light theme**: button backgrounds are no longer overly transparent, making them easier to spot and use.
