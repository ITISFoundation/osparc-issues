## ✨ Highlights

### 💬 Support Center — Read/Unread Messages

Staying up to date with your support chats just got easier.

From now on, the Support button (?) in the navigation bar will show a **dot whenever there’s a new unread message** from the Support Team. Inside the Support Center, conversations also clearly indicate which conversations are read and which are not.

> You’ll never miss an update again — making communication with the Support Team smoother and more responsive.

### 🔍 Search Files

Finding your data just got faster.

With the new **Search Files** feature, you can now **search across all files within your projects**. Results appear instantly and you can open the related project directly from the search results.

> Ideal for large workspaces or collaborative projects where quick access to files keeps your workflow moving.

### 🔄 Transfer Projects

You can now **transfer ownership of your projects** to another user — perfect for team transitions, handovers, or shared development.

When transferring, you can choose to:

* **Transfer full ownership**, or
* **Share while retaining co-ownership**, allowing smooth collaboration and continuity.


> This feature streamlines collaboration and ensures project continuity even when responsibilities shift.
