# Release Notes

### Version 1.86.0 · September 25, 2025

Stay tuned — the big highlights are just around the corner!

## ✨ Highlights

### User Profile 👤
* You can now view your contact information (provided during your account request) directly under **My Account → Profile → Contact**.
* This ensures full transparency on the data we store for contacting you or handling billing.

### 💬 Conversations
We’ve given chats a makeover! Conversations are now prettified for a cleaner, more pleasant reading experience.
- Improved spacing and layout make it easier to follow message flow.
- Inline elements (like code snippets, links, and lists) render with a consistent, polished style.

</div>

### 🏷️ Smarter Tag Filters
- To keep the dashboard clean, Tags filters have been removed from the main view. You can still filter by tags via the search bar, so nothing is lost.
- In the Tutorials tab, Tags remain visible — but now only those that are actually used by tutorials are listed, avoiding the long cluttered list from before.

</div>

### 🧠 Metamodeling
Managing functions just got easier! You can now delete functions directly in the Functions Browser, completing the set of essential actions for function management.

## 🛠 Fixes
