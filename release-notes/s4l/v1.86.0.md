# Release Notes

### Version 1.86.0 · October 7, 2025

Teamwork made simpler. Support made faster.

This release is all about collaboration and connection  — bringing people closer, whether you’re building together or getting help when you need it most.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🤝 Real-Time Collaboration
Work together seamlessly on shared projects — in real time.

Now, multiple users can **open and edit the same project simultaneously**, making teamwork smoother than ever. **This is especially useful if your workflow revolves around pipelines**, where you and your teammates can co-edit nodes, tweak parameters, and refine workflows together.

Here’s how it works:
1. One user opens a project as usual.
2. Another user with access to the same project (and the same credit account) can join the session.
3. For an even smoother experience, collaborators can chat using the 💬 Conversations feature right inside the platform.
4. Once joined, both users can edit the pipeline together, with changes appearing instantly for everyone.

The only current limitation: interactive services can’t be accessed simultaneously by multiple users — one at a time for now.

Real-Time Collaboration brings co-editing, helping teams build, test, and iterate together with zero friction.

### 🧑‍💻 Support Center
Need a hand? The brand-new Support Center connects you directly with the support team.
You can ask questions, report issues, or even schedule a video call — all without leaving the platform.
Whether it’s troubleshooting or guidance, help is now just one click away.

### 👤 User Profile
* You can now view your contact information (provided during your account request) directly under **My Account → Profile → Contact**.
* This ensures full transparency on the data we store for contacting you or handling billing.

### 💬 Conversations
We’ve given chats a makeover! Conversations are now prettified for a cleaner, more pleasant reading experience.
- Improved spacing and layout make it easier to follow message flow.
- Inline elements (like code snippets, links, and lists) render with a consistent, polished style.

### 🏷️ Smarter Tag Filters
- To keep the dashboard clean, Tags filters have been removed from the main view. You can still filter by tags via the search bar, so nothing is lost.
- In the Tutorials tab, Tags remain visible — but now only those that are actually used by tutorials are listed, avoiding the long cluttered list from before.

### 🧠 Metamodeling
Managing functions just got easier! You can now delete functions directly in the Functions Browser, completing the set of essential actions for function management.
