# Release Notes

## Sim4Life web services

- Seamless integration for new Models Marketplace
- Multiple Neuron Enhancements

## Platform

### 🛒 The Shop

To Do, take text and visuals? from official drafts


### ➕ Where Did the Plus Buttons Go?

We’ve streamlined the interface by merging the plus buttons into a single, more powerful bigger New Plus button! It has been relocated to the top left for better accessibility and now includes additional functionality to enhance your workflow.

You now have easier access to 2 more services: JupyterLab (powered by Sim4Life) and the Segmentation Tool!

</div>


### 🖼️ Project Cards Now Feature Icons

We’ve enhanced the Project Cards on the dashboard by adding icons! These icons provide a quick visual hint about what’s inside each project, making it easier to recognize them at a glance—no need to open the card to get an idea of its contents.

</div>


### 🌝 Simplified Full-Screen Mode

When starting a project it now opens in full-screen mode for a cleaner, more immersive experience. We’ve removed the small toolbar that was taking up valuable space, and the buttons/actions previously found there have been moved to the upper project menu.

#### New features

- Pay study's debt
- New trash bin for projects, folders and workspace [#468](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/468)
- New vendor specific resource tracking (VIP service) [#1732](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/1732)
  - Automatic syncronization with published VIP models from the IT'IS Foundation and phantoms from SPEAG
- When a user runs out of credits, their project is embargoed until their credit account is topped up to a positive balance or they use another credit account to cover the last transaction that caused the negative balance. This can be done by transferring enough credits between two credit accounts. [#7033](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7033)

#### Improvements

- Altenative email for POs to receive account requests [#7130](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/issues/7130)

- Front-end UI configuration stored in the backend [#1822](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/1822)


#### No longer broken

- Fixed issue where service starting time was unnecessary long [#7079](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7079)
- Fixed issue where project/study would remain locked unless page refresh was completed [#7044](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7044)
- Fixed issue where heavy dynamic services would fail to start [#7051](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7051)
