#### New features

- New trash bin for projects, folders and workspace [#468](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/468)
- New vendor specific resource tracking (VIP service) [#1732](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/1732)
  - Automatic syncronization with published VIP models from the IT'IS Foundation and phantoms from SPEAG
- When a user runs out of credits, their project is embargoed until their credit account is topped up to a positive balance or they use another credit account to cover the last transaction that caused the negative balance. This can be done by transferring enough credits between two credit accounts. [#7033](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7033)

#### Improvements

- Altenative email for POs to receive account requests [#7130](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/issues/7130)

- Front-end UI configuration stored in the backend [#1822](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-issues/issues/1822)


#### No longer broken

- Fixed issue where too many warm buffers would start incuring unnecessary waiting time [#7079](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7079)
- Fixed issue where project would remain locked unless page refresh was completed [#7044](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7044)
- Fixed issue where dynamic services with very bigger images would longer fail to start [#7051](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/osparc-simcore/pull/7051)
